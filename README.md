Manuscript and replication materials for paper "Ambivalence Everywhere"

- Functions: Contains R code for the finite mixture model function for three-, five-, and seven-response structures. 
	- Four-wave model, not used in the paper, is also avilable
	- Unbalanced model (different parameter estimates for strength on each side of the scale) is in progress.
- Models: Contains R code for cleaning and estimating finite mixture model on each question. Separate files for each data set.
- Questionmacro.csv: CSV containing question wording for all 544 questions analyzed in the paper. Includes tags for regression analysis.

Actual result data (estimation of model on all 544 questions) is too large to be stored on github, but results can be reproduced using publicly available data, functionds and models scripts.
